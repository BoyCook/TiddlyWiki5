You can import content into a TiddlyWiki file in several ways:

* Use the ''browse'' button to select one or more local files
* Drag and drop files from Windows Explorer or Mac OS X Finder into the TiddlyWiki5 browser window
* Paste content directly from the clipboard using the keyboard shortcut (control-V or command-V)
** Pasting is currently only supported in GoogleChrome
