title: Getting started with TiddlyWiki under node.js
modifier: JeremyRuston
tags: guide

TiddlyWiki5 can be used on the command line to perform an extensive set of operations based on tiddlers, TiddlerFiles and TiddlyWikiFiles. For example, this loads the tiddlers from a TiddlyWiki HTML file and then saves one of them in HTML:

```
node tiddlywiki.js --verbose --load mywiki.html --savetiddler ReadMe ./readme.html
```
!!Usage

Running `tiddlywiki.js` from the command line boots the TiddlyWiki kernel, loads the core plugins and establishes an empty wiki store. It then sequentially processes the command line arguments from left to right. The arguments are separated with spaces.

The first argument is the optional path to the wiki directory to be loaded. If not present, then the current directory is used.

The commands and their individual arguments follow, each command being identified by the prefix `--`.

```
node tiddlywiki.js [<wikipath>] [--<command> [<arg>[,<arg>]]]
```

!! Batch Files

For trying TiddlyWiki5 out under node.js, several batch files are provided:

* `bld.sh` builds the new TiddlyWiki 5 HTML file
* `2bld.sh` builds TiddlyWiki 2.6.5 from its original source

!!Commands

The following commands are available:
