title: ServerCommand
tags: docs command

The server built in to TiddlyWiki5 is very simple. Although compatible with TiddlyWeb it doesn't support many of the features needed for robust Internet-facing usage - in particular, TiddlyWiki5 is an old-school wiki in the sense that it offers no authentication.

At the root, it serves a rendering of a specified tiddler. Away from the root, it serves individual tiddlers encoded in JSON, and supports the basic HTTP operations for `GET`, `PUT` and `DELETE`.

```
--server <port> <roottiddler> <rendertype> <servetype>
```

For example:

```
--server 8080 $:/core/tiddlywiki5.template.html text/plain text/html
```

The parameters are:

```
--server <port> <roottiddler> <rendertype> <servetype>
```

* ''port'' - port number to serve from (defaults to "8080")
* ''roottiddler'' - the tiddler to serve at the root (defaults to "$:/core/tiddlywiki5.template.html") 
* ''rendertype'' - the content type to which the root tiddler should be rendered (defaults to "text/plain")
* ''servetype'' - the content type with which the root tiddler should be served (defaults to "text/html")
