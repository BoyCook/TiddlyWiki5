title: TiddlyWiki5 Standalone Edition
tags: docs edition

The standalone edition of TiddlyWiki5 is a single HTML file that contains both your content and the JavaScript code needed to provide a user interface for viewing and editting it. Your changes are preserved by generating an updated HTML file which can be saved in various ways, depending on your browser and configuration:

* Using the TiddlySpot upload service (or compatible)
* Using the Firefox extension TiddlyFox changes can be saved directly to the file system, so that your TiddlyWiki documents are updated in place
* Using the HTML `<a>` element letting the user manually save the modified file
** Recent browsers supporting the `download` attribute can automatically force the download at the cost of losing control of the location of the downloaded file
