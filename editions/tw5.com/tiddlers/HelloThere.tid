Welcome to TiddlyWiki5, a reboot of TiddlyWiki, the non-linear personal web notebook [[first released in 2004|History]]. It is a complete interactive wiki in JavaScript that can be run from a single HTML file in the browser or as a powerful [[node.js application|node.js]].

TiddlyWiki is designed to fit around your brain, giving you a better way of managing information than traditional documents and emails. The fundamental idea is that information is more useful and reusable if we cut it up into the smallest semantically meaningful chunks -- [[tiddlers|Tiddlers]] -- and give them titles so that they can be structured with links, tags and macros.  TiddlyWiki aims to provide a fluid interface for working with tiddlers, allowing them to be aggregated and composed into longer narratives.

TiddlyWiki5 has many [[improvements|Improvements]] over the original. It is currently labelled alpha, meaning it is working but incomplete. It is a great time to get involved and support its [[future development|RoadMap]]. You can:
