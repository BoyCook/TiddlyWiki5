title: How to use TiddlyWiki5 as a standalone HTML file with encryption
modified: 201304152154

[[TiddlyWiki5 Standalone Edition]] allows content to be encrypted using the [[Stanford JavaScript Crypto Library]].

# Scroll to the bottom of the page where you should see the words "This wiki is not encrypted" and a button labelled "Set password"
# Click "Set password"
# Type a password and click the "Set" button (or use the enter key)
# The control panel should now say "This wiki is encrypted" with buttons for changing and clearing the password
# Save the wiki using the "Save" button in the left sidebar
# Optionally, open the saved file in a text editor and verify that your data is encrypted
