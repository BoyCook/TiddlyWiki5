* `title` - The unique title of the tiddler
* `modified` - The date of the last modification to the tiddler
* `modifier` - The name of the last person to modify the tiddler
* `created` - The date the tiddler was created
* `creator` - The name of the person who created the tiddler
* `tags` - A list of tags applied to the tiddler
* `type` - The ContentType that should used to interpret the content of the tiddler
