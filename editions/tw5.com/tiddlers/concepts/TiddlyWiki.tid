TiddlyWiki is a rich, interactive interface for manipulating complex data with structure that doesn't easily fit into conventional tools like spreadsheets or wordprocessors.

TiddlyWiki is based on the idea of making information more useful by modelling it in the smallest meaningful semantic units, referred to as [[Tiddlers]].  Structure comes from links, tags, and sequences of tiddlers called stories. Tiddlers use a WikiText notation that concisely represents a wide range of text formatting and hypertext features.

People [[love using|Raves]] TiddlyWiki. Because it can be used without any complicated server infrastructure, and because it is [[open source|OpenSource]], it has bought unprecedented freedom to people to keep their precious information under their own control. TiddlyWiki was originally created by JeremyRuston and is now a thriving [[open source|OpenSource]] project with a busy [[Community]] of independent developers.
